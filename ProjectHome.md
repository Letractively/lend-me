This is our Information Systems Class Project, named lend-me. The professor Nazareno asked the students to construct a system of a social lending community, where users can borrow items from other users without having to pay for it, in a kind of (utopian?) socialist environment, similar to existent ones such as neighborgoods.

The goal of the teacher is to make the students improve their experiences regarding the addressed topics he teached them in theorical classes, all with a practical taste. Picking up this kind of software to be developed wasn't aimless: the idea is to develop something new. It is considered new because there's no system like that in Brazil.


lend-me is being developed by four undergraduate students in Computer Science at the Federal University at Campina Grande.

Their names are:
Guilherme S. G. Baptista, Pedro R. M. Limeira, Tarciso B. O. Filho and Manoel M. Neto
